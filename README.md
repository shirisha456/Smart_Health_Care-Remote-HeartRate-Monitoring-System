We have proposed a solution to the “heart rate monitoring system”. The system 
comprises of sensors for measuring heart rate and body temperature , and a 
cloudbased platform for data storage , analysis. 
The system communicates with the cloud platform through wireless connectivity 
protocols Wi-Fi. The cloud platform processes the data, performs analytics, and 
presents the information to the user in a user-friendly interface accessible through 
a web portal. 
The system also incorporates machine learning algorithms for detecting abnormal 
patterns in the data and triggering alerts for the user or their healthcare provider. 
The proposed system offers several benefits, including remote monitoring, and 
early detection of health issues, which can potentially improve patient outcomes 
and reduce healthcare costs.# Smart_Health_Care-Remote-HeartRate-Monitoring-System
